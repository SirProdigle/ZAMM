# Zeus-ArmA-Mission-Manager
Temporary Readme

An in-production Bookkeeping/Review site for Armed Assault 3 multiplayer servers. Reads directly from mission files to gather initial data and contains a robust system for editing data about misions (Objectives, Respawn enabled, etc.), filtering by said data, uploading/downloading/moving files directly via the web interface, User groups/permissions/management, and eventually more.

Live version hosted at missions.zeus-communit.net
